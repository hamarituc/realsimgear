# On the first build, every .c is dirty anyway.  On future builds, if the
# .c changes, it is rebuilt (as is its dep) so who cares if dependencies
# are stale.  If the .c is the same but a header has changed, this 
# declares the header to be changed.  If a primary header includes a 
# utility header and the primary header is changed, the dependency
# needs a rebuild because EVERY header is included.  And if the secondary
# header is changed, the primary header had it before (and is unchanged)
# so that is in the dependency file too.
